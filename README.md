## Infrastructure as Code

This project uses Terraform for infrastructure provisioning. The repository structure is as follows:

```
.
├── terraform/
│   ├── modules/
│   │   ├── cicd/           # CI/CD infrastructure module
│   │   ├── eks/            # EKS cluster module
│   │   └── vpc/            # VPC and networking module
│   ├── main.tf             # Main Terraform configuration
│   ├── variables.tf        # Variable definitions
│   ├── iam.tf              # IAM roles and policies
│   ├── backend.tf          # Backend configuration (references S3/DynamoDB)
│   └── bootstrap.tf        # Creates S3 bucket and DynamoDB for state management
└── README.md
```

### State Management

This project uses a remote state backend with the following components:

1. **S3 Bucket** (`enterprise-cicd-terraform-state`): Stores the Terraform state file
2. **DynamoDB Table** (`enterprise-cicd-terraform-locks`): Provides state locking to prevent concurrent modifications

These resources are created by `bootstrap.tf` and referenced by `backend.tf`. The first `terraform apply` will create these resources and then use them for state management.

## Security Considerations

- All resources are created in private subnets where possible
- Security groups follow least privilege principle
- IAM roles use least privilege permissions
- S3 buckets have versioning and encryption enabled
- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Automated compliance checks
- Secure credential management

## Monitoring and Observability

The monitoring stack includes:

- **Prometheus**: For metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana**: For visualization and dashboards
- **ELK Stack**: For log aggregation and analysis
- **Jaeger**: For distributed tracing
- **AlertManager**: For alert routing and notification

## Disaster Recovery

The disaster recovery plan includes:

- Regular backups of all critical data
- Multi-region deployment options
- Automated recovery procedures
- Regular disaster recovery testing
- Documented recovery runbooks

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for setting up a production-grade CI/CD pipeline using modern DevOps practices and tools. By following this plan, organizations can achieve a robust, secure, and efficient software delivery process that supports rapid innovation while maintaining stability and reliability.
