# TheUltimate CI/CD DevOps Implementation Blueprint

A comprehensive end-to-end CI/CD pipeline implementation blueprint that demonstrates modern DevOps practices for Java applications. This project provides a real-world implementation of the CI/CD pipeline, from infrastructure provisioning to container deployment.

## Project Overview

This project implements a complete CI/CD pipeline for a Java Spring Boot board game application using:

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with Terraform
- **Configuration Management** with Ansible
- **Continuous Integration** with Jenkins
- **Container Registry** with Nexus Repository Manager
- **Container Orchestration** with Kubernetes

## Repository Structure

```

├── Ansible/              # Configuration management
├── BoardGame/            # Sample Java Spring Boot application
├── Jenkins/              # Jenkins pipeline configuration
├── Kubernetes/           # Kubernetes deployment manifests
└── Terraform/            # Infrastructure as code
```

## Getting Started

To implement the complete CI/CD pipeline, follow these steps in order:

1. **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Use Terraform to provision the required AWS infrastructure
   - Go to the [Terraform directory](./Terraform/) and follow the instructions

2. **Configuration Management**: Use Ansible to configure the provisioned servers
   - Once infrastructure is ready, proceed to the [Ansible directory](./Ansible/)

3. **CI Pipeline Setup**: Configure Jenkins and create the CI pipeline
   - After server configuration, check the [Jenkins directory](./Jenkins/)

4. **Application Deployment**: Deploy the application to Kubernetes
   - Finally, head to the [Kubernetes directory](./Kubernetes/)

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- Terraform 1.0.0+
- Ansible 2.9+
- kubectl and Helm
- Docker
- Java 17 and Maven (for local development)
- Git

## The Example Application

The [BoardGame application](./BoardGame/) is a Spring Boot web application that demonstrates a simple board game catalog with user reviews. The application includes:

- User authentication and authorization
- CRUD operations for board games and reviews
- RESTful API endpoints
- Unit tests

## Project Lifecycle

This project implements the following CI/CD lifecycle:

1. **Development**: Developers write code and tests
2. **Version Control**: Code is pushed to Git repository
3. **Build & Test**: Jenkins pipeline builds and tests the application
4. **Containerization**: Application is packaged as a Docker image
5. **Security Scanning**: Docker image is scanned for vulnerabilities
6. **Artifact Storage**: Docker image is pushed to Nexus
7. **Deployment**: Application is deployed to Kubernetes

## Next Steps

Start by setting up your infrastructure with Terraform. Head to the [Terraform directory](./Terraform/) and follow the instructions to provision your AWS resources.
